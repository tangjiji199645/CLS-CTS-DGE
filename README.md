A) CeLEry tool was first used to infer the spatial locations of cells from the ROS/MAP snRNA-Seq data of DLPFC. 

B) Pseudo bulk read counts were generated from the scRNA-Seq data for each cell type in each cortical layer, which were used to conduct CLS-CTS DGE analyses of three AD-related phenotypes, Beta-amyloid, tangle density, and cognitive decline. Top significant genes from the CLS-CTS DGE analyses were further used to conduct gene set enrichment analyses.
